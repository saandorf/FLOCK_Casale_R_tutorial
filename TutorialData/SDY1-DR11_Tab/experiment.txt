EXP3727	The change in T-cell subsets consistent with these hypotheses will be determined by 4 color flow cytometry analyses. Baseline data will be obtained prior to treatment periods and compared for each participant with data acquired at various time points at each treatment, including during ragweed season and after discontinuation of therapy.	Omalizumab pre-treatment should favor a shift from Th2 to Th1 paradigm via multiple mechanisms including: a shift in DC2 to DC1predominence; decreased Fc&#949;R1 expression leading to allergen presentation not favoring Th2 responses; and inhibition of proliferation of allergen-specific T-cells by inhibiting the binding of allergen-IgE complexes to CD23 on B lymphocytes. Allergen IT has been shown to favor the shift from Th2 to Th1 responses via a variety of mechanisms. Thus, the combination should be more efficient in inducing this important immunotolerogenic effect.	ragweed allergy, allergen immunotherapy, T-helper1 and T-helper 2	FCM	Cellular_Quantification		Determine if RIT or omalizumab + RIT leads to an alteration in the numbers of putative CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells. Specifically this population can be monitored by the presence or increase in numbers of CD4+CD25+CD45RBlow cells.	RPCIFLOW_ITN019AD	990
